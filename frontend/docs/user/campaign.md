# Campaign overview

APLOSE regroups annotations sessions as an Annotation Campaign. 
Each campaign is linked to a dataset and to one or more annotators.

A campaign can be configured to show different spectrogram configurations, annotate different label or even to validate detectors output.

## All campaigns

You can view all campaigns your campaign on the Annotation Campaigns page
![](../assets/campaigns/all-campaigns_user.png)

You can search a campaign by its name or filter the list my the mode: create annotations or check detectors output.

Each campaign is described by its name, the dataset to annotate, the mode (create annotations or check detectors output).
Your progression and the global progression on the campaign is visible on each card.

You can access to the campaign detail by clicking on its card.

### Annotation files
The page shows the dataset file you were assigned for annotation. You can search a specific file or only show non submitted files or only files with annotations.
You can also directly resume annotation, this will take you to the first unsubmitted file. 

The file table contains the following columns:

| Column      | Description                                                                                                   |
